									<div class="section_header"><h4>Deep Work by Cal Newport</h4></div>
									<br><b>One liner:</b> In a connected world, how do you disconnect so that you can tackle your most cognitively challenging work without distraction?
									<br><br><b>How I came across the book:</b> I stumbled upon this book as a happy accident while perusing my local library. Madison’s public library system continues to amaze me. I am within biking distance of 3 libraries (that I know of) and  can check out audiobooks through an app without cost.
									<br><br><b>Why this book makes the list:</b> I have mixed feeling about this book. On one hand, the valuable content it includes could fit on a 3” x 5” index card (double sided to give the author some credit). On the other hand, it offers some great insight into how to identify work that needs “deep thought” to effectively complete. I kept this book on the list because the insights it offers actually caused me to significantly restructure the way I organize my day. This book, more so than any other professional development book I've read, has caused me to shift my habits.
									<br><br>I am now more aware of the types of work I need to perform throughout the day. For the challenging, creative work that requires “deep thought”, I partition it from the rest of the day that is stuffed full of emails, meetings, and calls. When it is time to work on my “deep thought” projects, I enter into a routine that allows me to flush distraction and focus on the task at hand. I take a quick walk (often to fill up on coffee) to briefly physically separate myself from all of the high urgency, low importance tasks that can distract me. When I return I close the door to my office, close my laptop, put my phone away, and then whiteboard my thoughts.
									<br><br>I adopted a few other habits as a result of this book that I won’t detail here. A large portion of the book is also focused on identifying tasks that are unimportant, either for you personally or the business. So if you are interested in shifting your work habits to either work more effectively or work on more impactful projects, I recommend you give this a read.

									<div class="section_header"><h4>Guns, Germs, and Steel by Jared Diamond</h4></div>
									<br><b>One liner:</b> An incredibly thought provoking and ambitious work that attempts to explain why European and North African cultures have persisted and dominated the last 10,000 years.
									<br><br><b>How I came across the book:</b> I’m not sure when I first stumbled upon this book. I’ve always been interested in history, especially from the perspective of how science and technology help drive societal change. Watching Modern Marvels on the History Channel was always a favorite past time. This book, along with others like ‘The World is Flat’ by Thomas Friedman, fits squarely into my favorite type of non-fiction.
									<br><br><b>Why this book makes the list:</b> Put simply, this book makes you think. Whether you ultimately end up agreeing with Diamond’s conclusions or not, he take a scientific approach to a topic whose arguments have historically been diluted with opinion and rhetoric.The book is dry is places (many places) but this is a testament to the thoughtful approach taken in developing the argument. If you are a fan of history, science, or sociology on a large scale, I recommend reading this book.

									<div class="section_header"><br><h4>Drive by Daniel Pink</h4></div>
									<br><b>One liner:</b> Professional motivation and engagement are dependent on three pillars: Autonomy, Mastery, and Purpose.
									<br><br><b>How I came across this book:</b> This book is frequently suggested at Epic as a read for professional development. It is given to all new managers and available to be checked out for free. I read it within my first year at Epic before becoming a manager. I found it to be useful and valuable when considering my own personal motivation. It has remained relevant as I have worked with team members and managed other team leads.
									<br><br><b>Why it makes the list:</b> It is one of the few professional development books I’m come across that is valuable all the way through. I’m a believer that most personal improvement books could have their message adequately delivered via a 5-10 page article. Unfortunately for the readers of these publications, 5-10 page articles don’t sell as well as books. So instead we get novels filled with trite examples and filler pages. Drive is not one of those books. It has insight all along the way.
									<br><br>The book’s three pillars align with some ideals I have adopted as axioms as a manager: No one comes to work wanting to do a bad job. Delegate outcomes, not processes. Individuals/teams/divisions cannot have purpose without leadership setting a clear, narrow vision.
									<br><br>Regardless of if you are starting your first job, considering changing careers, or just starting to get into management, I highly suggest reading this book.

									<div class="section_header"><h4>The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand</h4><br></div>
									<br><i> Disclaimer (somewhat ironic given the below): I am not an adherent to either Objectivism or Randian egoism. The conclusions she reaches in this and her other works are extreme and if applied in the real world would result in a fair but unjust world.</i>
									<br><br><b>One liner:</b> A book about a man, alone in a world of sycophants, motivated exclusively by his self interests such that his pursuits are pure and ultimately produce great things.
									<br><br><b>How I came across this book:</b> I was first exposed to this book through an assignment in college for a course on manufacturing engineering. The course was core to the mechanical engineering curriculum and scientifically rigorous. This book did not fit the course in anyway. The professor (Dr Schmid) assigned it because of the same reasons I outline below: it's an amazing story about living a life of purpose, developing a passion for a craft, and ultimately finding joy in life not through others’ measure but your own. I’ve picked it up 2 or 3 times since that class and find myself drawn to it whenever I need to be regrounded.
									<br><br><b>Why it makes the list:</b> The novel centers around Howard Roark, an architect of immense talent and unyielding character. He shirks professional fame and commercial success in favor of pursuing his passion. He refuses to conform to popular opinion. While Rand goes off the deep end a few times throughout the novel (there’s a ~10 page monologue where it appears she thinks she is writing a philosophical paper rather than a novel), Roark’s character carries the novel. He is simply a man with clearly defined passions and an indomitable will to pursue them without compromise. The simplicity of his life is admirable and something that inspires me.
