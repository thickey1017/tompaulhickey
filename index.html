										While at ND I studied mechanical engineering with a minor in engineering corporate practice. Heat transfer and thermodynamics were by far the courses I found most interesting within the mechanical discipline. You can sum up both of these courses as “how to heat a potato” and “how a potato heats overtime”, respectively. While not riveting stuff on the surface, the simplicity of the laws governing these actions is beautiful and was fun to learn.
										<br><br>The minor in engineering corporate practice exposed me to a core set of business courses (accounting, finance, economics) presented through the lense of engineering firms. It has given me a baseline of financial literacy that has benefited me at both work and in my own finances.
										<br><br>Outside of academics,  I played for the rugby team where I captained the squad my senior year. Of all my experiences at Notre Dame, this was by far the most impactful and the one that shaped me the most. I learned what it means to be truly passionate about something and how perceived limits of self can be pushed and overcome. To sum it all up, one of my coaches' mottos I've adopted as my own:
										<br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><i>“Purpose, Pace, Power”</i></div>
										<br>In all things you do, ensure there is purpose behind it. If there is no purpose in your efforts or actions, you should not be wasting your energy on it.
										Once you find something worth doing, do it with pace. Do it quickly and put all your energy toward it. If it’s worth doing, it’s worth doing in earnest.
										Finally, with all things you do, do it with power. Overcome hurdles, barriers, distractions by having conviction in what you are doing.
										<br><br>When I first heard this quote, it was in the context of how to run the ball such that you smash the opponent trying to tackle you. Regardless, it rings true in all arenas of life.

									Interning at Amazon.com was my second real job. My first job was working for a family friend at Wirth Development Corporation as a construction gopher. My summer was filled with digging ditches, digging holes, and, on the easy days, sweeping out housing frames. It was both the hottest summer and longest drought period in Virginia’s history (At least it felt that way. Some of my Uncle Joe’s hyperbolic story-telling tendencies have rubbed off over the years). The job taught me a lot of things, like how valuable hydrating is, how hard digging holes in dry clay is, and how you need to treat any Gatorade bottles left behind by construction crews with care. More importantly, it gave me an appreciation for the folks who work in those conditions for the majority of their lives.
									<br><br>I worked as an intern for Amazon.com for two summers while an undergrad. I was a part of their Operations Intern Program where you train and work as an area manager within one of their distribution centers. To use Amazon’s words, “ The Operations Internship Program is a leadership pipeline to our future positions at Amazon.As an intern within Amazon Operations you will have visibility into one of the world’s most complex supply chain networks.” I spent both summers training as an area manager and ultimately running ~50 person shifts. Additionally, as a capstone to each summer I developed and executed on two continuous improvement projects using the principles of the Toyota Kata.
									<br><br>Working for a corporation as large as Amazon exposed me to a number of great experiences and insights. I realized the smallest of process improvements has the potential to save millions when you operate on the scale Amazon does. My second summer I worked in a 2 million square foot warehouse. To put some perspective on its size, they had adult-size tricycles for employees to ride indoors as it would take ~15 minutes to walk from one end of the building to the other.
									<br><br><div style="text-align:center"><img src="./images/amazonscale.jpg" class="expTabImg" width="550px;" height="auto"><br><i>The distribution center I worked in my second summer</i></div>
									<br><br>The thing that impressed me the most about Amazon was how consistent each distribution center was, both physically and culturally. I worked in or visited four different distribution centers over the two summers. These warehouses were so  similar you could drop an area manager into a warehouse they have never seen and that manager could successfully run the shift.
									<br><br>The leadership culture Amazon professes is also one it lives (in my experience at least). Amazon has fourteen principles of leadership that were frequently demonstrated while I worked with them. They consistently make decisions and invest in actions that align with their primary principle of “customer obsession”. This is their differentiator. They are not a company that sells books. They are a company that sells customer experience. They just happen to sell books (and dog food, and everything under the sun). This differentiator is why I think they will be successful as they venture out beyond their core business of goods distribution.
									<br><br>After the two summers, I came to realize work in distribution centers was not for me. In many ways Amazon has fully optimized their warehouses and the opportunities to make a large impact in my first few years at the company seemed slim. While I had the opportunity to work in the role full-time upon graduation I decided to go to Epic instead.

										I currently work at Epic Systems as a Technical Services Team Lead Manager on the MyChart team. MyChart is the patient engagement platform our customers extend to their patients so they can take control of their own care. The most exciting thing about working at Epic is the industry it is in. Healthcare IT is a growth industry that is at  the intersection of two incredible areas: healthcare and technology. 
										<br><br>Being a part of the healthcare industry is rewarding and exciting as there is incredible purpose behind the work you do. Healthcare impacts everyone at some point in their lives. It is easy to see the value you produce in the world when you work in healthcare. You simply need to look at the people in your life who are patients to see where your efforts impact the world.
										<br><br>The other exciting, if unfortunate, aspect of healthcare is how much opportunity there is to improve. Unlike the Amazon warehouse that is refined and nearly over-engineered, healthcare in America is inefficient and wasteful. There are tremendous opportunities to improve the “Triple Aim” of healthcare (improving the health of the population, reducing the costs associated with care, and improving the patient experience).
										<br><br>And that’s where technology comes into play. Software allows you to very quickly respond to new problems and iterate rapidly until a solution is found. Whether it’s sharing progress notes electronically with patients so they don’t forget the care plan that was discussed or allowing patients to complete questionnaires at home where they are more likely to answer honestly, there are so many ways technology can positively impact care today.
										<br><br>That’s what gets me up in the morning.
